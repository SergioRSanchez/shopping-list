<h1><strong>Shopping List</strong></h1>

<p>Thirty-fourth Challenge was to create shopping list page. Localstorage is used to store list items and their properties. The application has hover effects and custom styling if completed, as well as buttons for deleting the item from the list and erasing the complete list. I made it using Next.Js with TypeScript and Tailwind!</p>
